<span style="font-size:3em;">
I am a second year PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Manchester, supervised by [Dr. Tingting Mu](https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/tingting.mu/Site/About_Me.html) and [Prof. Uli Sattler](http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~sattler/).

My area of reserach rovolves around symbolic knowledge driven machine learning for vision applications.

collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-1
excerpt: "Parallel manipulation can offer a number of advantages over conventional serial manipula- tion with respect to optimising operational speed while retaining high accuracy in position- ing. In this study a parallel robot manipulator was developed to achieve precise end effector positioning in a three-dimensional workspace. The mechanical assembly, the kinematics analysis and the control programme were built and composed from scratch and several ap- plications were executed in the end to test the operational capabilities of the robot."

Parallel manipulation can offer a number of advantages over conventional serial manipula- tion with respect to optimising operational speed while retaining high accuracy in position- ing. In this study a parallel robot manipulator was developed to achieve precise end effector positioning in a three-dimensional workspace. The mechanical assembly, the kinematics analysis and the control programme were built and composed from scratch and several ap- plications were executed in the end to test the operational capabilities of the robot.
